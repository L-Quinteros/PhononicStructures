# Phononic Structure Repository

This repository contains code for optimizing and plotting a 2D truss phononic structure. Feel free to use the code, and if you find it useful, please cite [[1]](#1).

To get started:

1. Add the "GCMMA_MMA" and "src" folders to your MATLAB path.
2. Execute OptimizingAndPlot.m to optimize a 2D truss phononic structure and display the band diagram.
